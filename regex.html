            Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
            Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
            <br>   <br>
            Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
            Because their words had forked no lightning they,
            Do not go gentle into that good night.
            <br>   <br>
            Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright,
            Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
            <br>   <br>
            Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
            And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
            Do not go gentle into that good night.
            <br>   <br>
            Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight,
            Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
            <br>   <br>
            And you, my father, there on the sad height,
            Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
            Do not go gentle into that good night.
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light,
